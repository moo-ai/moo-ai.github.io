                            <b>Machine Learning On Openlab</b>(MOO) is a web service that can reproduce Machine
                            Learning(ML) training or inferring environment for ML developers or operators.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Nowadays, developers can easily download some ML models from internet(e.g some ML model
                            marketplaces). Those models are either trained or not. To use them, developers have to
                            setup the specified ML environment. While there is a fact that even using the same model,
                            if the enviroment is diffrenet, the ML result would be different as well. Developers need
                            to config the environment repeatly to make the result better. Once they want to use the
                            model in another environment, they need to config it again. There is no way to describ the
                            environment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We now provide you a way to describ ML environment following a metadata description
                            standard. With this standard, developers can create a environment description file easily.
                            Then MOO can reproduce the same ML environment for developers using the file quickly and
                            esaily. Please follow the <a href="guide.html" class="text-primary">guide</a> to learn more
                            abort the ML metadata standard.

                            MOO which is based on <a href="https://openlabtesting.org/" class="text-primary">OpenLab</a>
                            aims to reproduce ML environment following the metadata description standard mentioned
                            above. The workflow is described by the picture below.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            MOO is still under development. In the futrue, we'll provide a tool for generating the
                            metadata file automaticlly as well.
                        </p>
